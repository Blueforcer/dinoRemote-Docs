# Remote maintenance


Remote maintenance allows direct access to the system. The screen is transmitted 1:1.
You can navigate through the system as if you were standing right in front of it.
Every screen change is also carried out on site.

You can also perform remote maintenance in full screen mode. To do this, click on "FULL PICTURE".
Another browser tab opens and only the screen of the installation can be seen. If you want real full screen on your monitor, press F11 on your keyboard.
If you press F11 again, the full screen mode of the browser is closed again.

The SuperUser code is only visible to specialist dealers or dinotec employees.
