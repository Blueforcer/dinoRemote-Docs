The LiveView consists of "modules".

LiveView is used exclusively for displaying various values. Control is not possible.

The modules can consist of different displays:  
+ **canister**  
    Displays the fill level of the canister graphically  
+ **Hygenic parameters**  
    Displays a parameter on a color scale  
+ **Bit status**
    Displays individual states  
+ **Register**  
    Displays individual values  

In addition, the circulation to which this information belongs is displayed for each module.  

In the upper area you can search for existing modules.  

You also have the possibility to configure your own modules via the expert mode.
    
**ATTENTION:**  
This function is able to display any information about the system and is only recommended for users who are familiar with the internal structure of the system software.
