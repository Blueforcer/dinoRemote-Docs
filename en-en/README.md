# DinoRemote  
  
There is no doubt that having access to your swimming pool technology from anywhere in the world at any time has many advantages. So you can easily set the water temperature down during your holiday to save energy or to find out if and when new water care products are needed. Maintenance, optimization and problem solving can be carried out quickly and cost-effectively directly "through the line". However, despite all the joy at the benefits of such functions, the issue of security must not be ignored.
  
   
  
**Secure remote access**  
  
dinotec GmbH is one of the leading suppliers of modern control systems. Therefore, it is obvious that the Hessian company has been dealing with the topic of data and access security for a long time. For example, a multi-level password-protected authorization system is a standard feature of all dinotecNET+ systems. This prevents, for example, unauthorized persons from changing important system settings. 
The latest development from the control specialists also deals with secure remote access to the swimming pool control system. Very few people are aware that every halfway experienced "computer kid" can gain access to an unsecured network (e.g. through DynDNS, port shares, etc.) in just a few minutes. Depending on which other systems are hanging in the LAN, much more than "just" the swimming pool control can be manipulated. "We had already had customers with whom we had gained access to their POS systems through our remote access. Certainly the customer was grateful that we showed him this security gap, but afterwards he also had a sinking feeling in his stomach" says Andreas Schmidt, CEO of dinotec. "Of course we point out to our customers that they should coordinate with their IT specialists in all questions of network security, but for many people such questions are simply "Bohemian villages", for this reason we have developed our dinoRemote", Schmidt continues.  
  
    
  
**dino Remote securely encrypted**  
  
With dinoRemote, dinotec has developed a cloud-based solution that enables easy remote access according to current security standards. The web portal is secured by secure AES-256 encryption, CSRF backup, authenticated API calls, and HTTPS. Communication to the system takes place through an extremely secure VPN tunnel with Blowfish 4096Bit encryption. The connection of a system to the dinoRemote is very simple and only takes a few steps.  
  
The swimming pool owner can additionally activate his specialist dealer and dinotec for remote control of his technology via dinoRemote. It also determines to which email addresses the system messages are sent. The dinotec specialist dealer has a quick and comfortable overview of all systems he has in his monitoring via dinoRemote. dinoRemote enables the specialist dealer to offer a safe, fast and direct service for his customers. A quick look into the dinoRemote is enough and the specialist dealer is informed about the system status. He also sees whether he can bring fresh water care products to the next local appointment, for example.
