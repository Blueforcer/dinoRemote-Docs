Registration of a new user

By clicking on "Register" on the homepage https://remote.dinotec.de you reach an input mask for registering a new user.
End customers, specialist dealers and dealer employees can register here. If you already have access to dinoRemote, this step is not necessary.

If you would like to register as a specialist dealer or its employee, click on "I would like to register as a specialist dealer" in the upper area and enter the company name and your customer number.
All following input fields must be filled in by every new user. All input fields marked with a red asterisk are mandatory.

If you as an end customer have a supporting specialist dealer, enter the company name of the dealer in the lowest input field. A dinotec employee will then assign your account to the appropriate dealer, if available.

As soon as you have completed your entries by clicking on "Register", a dinotec employee will take care of your registration and release it as quickly as possible. If the registration has been checked, you will receive an email shortly afterwards to your specified email address, in which you will be asked to provide your personal password via a link. Directly after that you have access to dinoRemote.
